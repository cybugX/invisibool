//! The encrypted-at-rest vault: holds registered values, AEAD-wrapped
//! under a key fetched from the keychain.
//!
//! ## What this module is
//!
//! At rest, the vault is one file on disk: a fixed 20-byte header
//! (magic + version + reserved), a 24-byte XChaCha20-Poly1305 nonce,
//! and the AEAD ciphertext of the JSON-serialized registered values.
//! In memory while the engine is running, the vault is a list of
//! [`format::VaultEntry`] structs ready to be turned into the
//! engine's [`crate::tokenizer::fpe::RegisteredValue`] set.
//!
//! ## Cryptographic design (load-bearing; do not change without a
//! security review)
//!
//! - **AEAD: XChaCha20-Poly1305.** 192-bit nonce; random per-encrypt
//!   from the OS CSPRNG. Collision probability at q writes is q^2 /
//!   2^192 (a 192-bit birthday bound), which is below any meaningful
//!   threshold for any realistic vault write count. No persistent
//!   nonce counter is required, eliminating that whole failure mode.
//! - **AEAD key derivation.** HKDF-SHA-256 with `salt = empty`,
//!   `ikm = vault_key` (fetched from the keychain), `info =
//!   "invisibool-vault-aead-v1"`. The versioned info string lets a
//!   future M4a rotate the derivation independently of the vault key.
//!   The same `vault_key` is the HKDF `ikm` for the FF1 subkey
//!   (separate info string, so the derived keys are independent).
//! - **AAD = first 20 bytes of the file** (magic + version +
//!   reserved). Tampering with any of those bytes makes Poly1305
//!   verification fail. Version-in-AAD specifically defeats downgrade
//!   attacks: a v2 reader cannot accept a v1 file even under the same
//!   vault key.
//! - **Atomic write.** Write to a sibling tmp file with `0o600` at
//!   create time, fsync, rename over the target, fsync the parent
//!   directory. At any crash point the on-disk state is either the
//!   old vault intact or the new vault durable, never a half-written
//!   file. The orphan-scan path at open cleans up any leftover tmp
//!   file from a previous crashed write.
//! - **No hand-rolled crypto.** Every primitive is from RustCrypto
//!   (`chacha20poly1305`, `hkdf`, `sha2`). The vault module only
//!   composes them.
//!
//! ## Crash safety + the OS CSPRNG
//!
//! Every random byte (vault key generation, nonce generation) flows
//! through [`os_random`], which calls `getrandom::fill` and PANICS on
//! failure. The PANIC CONTRACT documented on that helper is
//! load-bearing: a non-random nonce makes XChaCha20-Poly1305 unsafe;
//! a non-random vault key makes every future encrypt brute-forceable.
//! Returning an error here would let a caller paper over the failure
//! with a degraded fallback, so the helper has no `Result` by design.
//!
//! ## Zeroize coverage
//!
//! Five wipeable surfaces:
//! - vault key from keychain: `SecretBox<[u8; 32]>` from
//!   `keychain::fetch_or_create`, dropped after AEAD key derivation
//! - derived AEAD key: `Zeroizing<[u8; 32]>`, dropped at end of
//!   encrypt or decrypt
//! - decrypted plaintext bytes: `Zeroizing<Vec<u8>>`, dropped after
//!   serde_json parsing into VaultContents
//! - the ciphertext + nonce buffer assembled for write: dropped at
//!   end of save (no Zeroize needed; ciphertext is not secret)
//! - each registered value string in VaultEntry: plain `String`
//!   during the (short) deserialize window; moved into the engine's
//!   own `Zeroizing<String>` when `into_registered` runs. The
//!   serde_json intermediate allocation is a documented residual in
//!   the threat model.
