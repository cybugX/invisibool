//! Deterministic generator for the committed bench corpus.
//!
//! Produces the three fixture files exercised by `benches/scrub.rs`:
//!
//!   tests/fixtures/prose_2kb.txt    - ~2 KB English prose with 3 secrets
//!   tests/fixtures/source_64kb.rs   - ~64 KB synthetic Rust source (no secrets)
//!   tests/fixtures/log_1mb.log      - ~1 MB synthetic access log (no secrets)
//!
//! All three are written by a fixed-output procedure with no randomness, so
//! re-running this example after any source change reproduces the exact
//! bytes that should be committed. CI's regression tripwire pins on these
//! fixtures, so the committed bytes must match what this generator emits -
//! a regen drift would silently move the baseline.
//!
//! Every secret-shaped token in the prose fixture uses an `inv-EXAMPLE-`
//! prefix and a body whose first characters spell `EXAMPLE`. The prefix
//! is project-namespaced (no third-party scanner has a rule for it), and
//! the `EXAMPLE` marker is the project's convention for fixture-only
//! secret-shaped data - it tells both human readers and third-party
//! secret scanners that the value is bench input, not a real credential.
//!
//! Run from the workspace root:
//!     cargo run --example gen_bench_fixtures -p invisibool-engine
